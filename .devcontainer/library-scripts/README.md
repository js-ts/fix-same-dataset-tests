# Maintenance Note

The contents of this folder are sourced from [vscode-dev-containers](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dev-containers) repository's [script-library folder](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dev-containers/tree/master/script-library). Any changes that are necessary should be contributed upstream to that repository instead.

The latest versions can be pulled from the upstream repo directly, for example:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/vscode-dev-containers/main/script-library/docker-in-docker-debian.sh -O docker-in-docker-debian.sh
```
